# Student Dashboard Activity Tracking System

## Overview

The Student Dashboard has been completely redesigned to provide comprehensive activity tracking across 5 key categories. The system dynamically fetches data from Firebase Firestore and provides real-time visualizations using Chart.js.

## Architecture

### Authentication Flow
1. **Firebase Auth Integration**: Uses Firebase Authentication to identify current user
2. **Email-Based Matching**: Matches authenticated user's email with student records in Firestore
3. **Immediate Data Population**: Loads user info immediately upon authentication
4. **Auth Guards**: Redirects to login if user is not authenticated

### Data Structure

#### Student Records
```javascript
{
  id: "student_001",
  firstName: "Anoop",
  lastName: "Gupta", 
  fullName: "Anoop Gupta",
  email: "anupthegreat007@gmail.com",
  studentId: "STU20240001",
  major: "Computer Science",
  year: 3,
  gpa: "3.85",
  status: "active"
}
```

#### Activity Records
```javascript
{
  id: "activity_0001",
  studentId: "student_001",
  studentName: "Anoop Gupta",
  studentEmail: "anupthegreat007@gmail.com",
  courseId: "course_02",
  courseName: "Data Structures & Algorithms",
  activityType: "assignment_submission",
  category: "Assignment Uploads", // New categorization field
  title: "Data Structures & Algorithms Assignment #3",
  score: 8,
  maxScore: 10,
  quality: 87,
  engagementLevel: 8.5,
  timestamp: "2024-09-25T14:30:00.000Z",
  status: "completed"
}
```

- `teachers`: Teacher information for activity attribution

### Authentication Requirements
- User must be authenticated via Firebase Auth
- Email must match a student record in Firestore
- Automatic redirect to login if not authenticated

### Performance Optimizations
- **Indexed Queries**: Activities indexed by studentEmail and category
- **Batch Loading**: Efficient data fetching with proper error handling
- **Chart Caching**: Chart instances reused to prevent memory leaks
- **Loading States**: Immediate UI feedback during data operations

## User Experience

### Dynamic Loading
1. Page loads with authentication check
2. User info populated immediately from Firebase Auth
3. Activity data fetched and categorized dynamically
4. Charts rendered with real data
5. No static "Loading..." text anywhere
